# lemonade-language
üçã An approachable beginner programming language!
### Credits
This projects was inspired by reading this article: [I wrote a programming language. Here‚Äôs how you can, too](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-programming-language-pipeline-91d3f449c919/?gi=25625ae8b816). Lemonade was built using [ANTLR](https://www.antlr.org/) (specifically ANTLR4) and [LLVM](https://llvm.org/). Other tools used include the Eclipse IDE and the ANTLR 4 IDE 0.3.6 plugin.

Some helpful links I accessed are:
* [On using ANTLR and LLVM together](https://theantlrguy.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ANTLR3/pages/2687062/LLVM) (note: this pertains to ANTLR3)
* [On parser generators and ANTLR](https://ocw.mit.edu/ans7870/6/6.005/s16/classes/18-parser-generators/)
