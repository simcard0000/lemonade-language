# lemonade-language

<img src="https://github.com/simcard0000/lemonade-language/blob/master/lemonadeLogo.png" width = 300>

üçã An approachable beginner programming language! Primarily aimed at younger students, Lemonade is a statically typed language which is an intuitive and easy way to learn basic concepts such as logic.

### To-Do

- [ ] create documentation for the language
- [ ] finish making the language Turing complete

### Credits
This project was inspired by reading this article: [I wrote a programming language. Here‚Äôs how you can, too](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-programming-language-pipeline-91d3f449c919/?gi=25625ae8b816). Lemonade is built using [ANTLR](https://www.antlr.org/) (specifically ANTLR4) and (soon) [LLVM](https://llvm.org/). Other tools used include the Eclipse IDE and the ANTLR 4 IDE 0.3.6 plugin.

This project was previously called "jotter", and it all started out as a project in Gr. 12. I've been taking a break from further coding to do some research; such as by reading this interesting [master's thesis on building a compiler using ANTLR and LLVM](https://oatd.org/oatd/record?record=handle%5C%3A10211.3%5C%2F158484). The plan is to move away from being an interpreted language, and I believe building a compiler will be a great learning experience.
